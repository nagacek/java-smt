/**
 * An interface to an incremental SMT solver with methods for pushing and popping formulas as well
 * as SAT checks. Instances of this class can be used once for a series of related queries. After
 * that, the {@link #close} method should be called (preferably using the try-with-resources
 * syntax). All methods are expected to throw {@link IllegalStateException}s after close was called.
 *
 * <p>All solving methods are expected to throw {@link SolverException} if the solver fails to solve
 * the given query, and {@link InterruptedException} if a thread interrupt was requested or a
 * shutdown request via the {@link ShutdownNotifier}. It is not guaranteed, though, that solvers
 * respond in a timely manner (or at all) to shut down or interrupt requests.
